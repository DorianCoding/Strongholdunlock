# Strongholdunlock
Unlock all missions in Stronghold Crusader.
## TODO
1. Disable Steam Cloud (get on Steam, click on the game, properties and disable Steam Cloud).
2. Look for this file `crusader.cfg`. It should be located in Documents/Stronghold crusader.
3. Clone this git or download the binary that corresponds to your OS (Windows/Linux). You can also recompile the source code `Stronghold.c`.
4. Put this executable in the same directory as the `crusader.cfg` file.
5. Open the cmd in this directory (right click/open in cmd) or typing cmd in the search bar.
6. Type the name of the executable followed by the name of the file such as : `Stronghold_windows64.exe crusader.cfg`.
7. Reopen the game and enjoy. All missions has been unlocked.
